          <h3>ðŸŽ„ Season's Greetings, Programmers! ðŸŽ„</h3>
          <p>
            This December, we invite you to tackle this yearâ€™s Advent of Code puzzles using the Unison programming language! Itâ€™s a great opportunity to explore a unique language and connect with a friendly community of fellow developers. Hereâ€™s a bit more about Unison and how you can join in.
          </p>

          <h3>What makes Unison different?</h3>
          <p>
            Unison is a statically typed functional programming language that
            <a href="/docs/the-big-idea/" target="_blank">reimagines how code is saved, shared, and executed.</a>
            It might look familiar for folks who are fans of Python's
            whitespacing rules or who are familiar with ML-style languages:
          </p>

          <pre><code>myResult : Nat
myResult = Nat.range 0 10
  |> List.map (x -> x + 100)
  |> List.filter isEven
  |> List.foldLeft (acc n -> acc * n ) 1</code></pre>

          <p>
            But unlike traditional languages, Unison assigns a unique hash to
            every definition based on its <em>content.</em> Your code is saved
            programmatically by its hash, not as a bag of text on the file
            system.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of this core difference, Unison can provide a seamless
            developer experience for managing dependencies, deploying and
            running code, and scaling applications in distributed systems.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h3>Kick Off with the Unison Advent of Code Template</h3>
          <p>
            Unison's dedicated <strong>Advent of Code template project</strong>
            is just one of the tools and libraries we've written to make coding contain less context-switching. With this template, you can:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Authenticate with the Advent of Code platform and download your puzzle inputs</li>
            <li>Solve and submit puzzles directly within the Unison Codebase Manager and your IDE</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            No need to hop between tools or juggle filesâ€”our goal with Unison is to simplify the development process.
          </p>

          <h3>Collaborate and Share</h3>
          <p>
            Dive into thoughtfully crafted solution write-ups and Unison Docs
            from past participants, or write your own. In Unison, documentation
            is code. You can include typechecked, running code in your docs.
          </p>

            Check out some highlights from 2023 and 2022 and help us continue
            the tradition of sharing what you learn.
