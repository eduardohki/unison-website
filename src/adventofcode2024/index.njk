          <h3>A bit about Unison, for the uninitiated</h3>

          <p>
            Unison is a general-purpose, statically typed functional programming
            language in which functions are saved and identified by a hash of
            their AST, not as text values on a file system.
            <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/the-big-idea/">
              We think this decision has radical consequences
            </a>
            and built everything from <a href="https://share.unison-lang.org/">
              our code hosting tooling
            </a> and <a href="https://www.unison.cloud/">cloud platform</a>
            to suit this new programming model. ðŸ˜Ž
