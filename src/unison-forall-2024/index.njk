            <h3>A bit about Unison, for the uninitiated</h3>

            <p>
              Unison is a general-purpose, statically typed functional programming
              language in which functions are saved and identified by a hash of
              their AST, not as text values on a file system.
              <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/the-big-idea/">
                We think this decision has radical consequences
              </a>
              and built everything from <a href="https://share.unison-lang.org/">
                our code hosting tooling
              </a> and <a href="https://www.unison.cloud/">cloud platform</a>
              to suit this new programming model. üòé

                Language parsing is indispensable for software development. It
                enables various functionalities like syntax checking, code
                navigation, refactoring, and static analysis. Tree Sitter is a
                parser generator and incremental parsing library. This talk
                will cover how parsing a language works and how the Tree Sitter
                grammar for Unison was written.

                Backpropagation is the backbone of training neural networks,

                down the essentials of backpropagation in a relaxed,
                approachable way, explaining the core concepts and the
                intuition behind the math. We‚Äôll conclude with a dive into how
                to implement backpropagation in Unison.
