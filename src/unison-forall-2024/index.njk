            <h3>A bit about Unison, for the uninitiated</h3>

            <p>
              Unison is a general-purpose, statically typed functional programming
              language in which functions are saved and identified by a hash of
              their AST, not as text values on a file system.
              <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/the-big-idea/">
                We think this decision has radical consequences
              </a>
              and built everything from <a href="https://share.unison-lang.org/">
                our code hosting tooling
              </a> and <a href="https://www.unison.cloud/">cloud platform</a>
              to suit this new programming model. üòé

              <p>Turing machines are a universal computing model that are
                very capable. But even they have their limitations. Some

              <p>One class of functions is called the busy beaver problem;
                for a Turing machine of a number of states. How many steps

                systems, a world where we need fences, leases, shards and view changes to make
                our system scalable and resilient. We will learn how to implement those
                standard techniques on Unison Cloud, and then discuss the unique optimisations
                enabled  by its innovative combination of features.
