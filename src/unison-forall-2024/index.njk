            <h2>Busy Beaver Problem </h2>
            <h3>Daan van Berkel</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Turing machines are a universal computing model that are
                very capable. But even they have there limitations. Some
                functions are uncomputable.
              </p>

              <p>One class of functions is called the busy beaver problem;
                for a Turing machine of a number of states. How many steps
                can they take before they halt?

            <div>
              <p>CLIs and cloud services are right in Unison‚Äôs wheelhouse,
                but often you want to put a GUI in front of the end user.
                What does that look like in the Unison ecosystem?
              </p>

              <p>
                This talk will survey approaches to building Unison UIs
                today, then speculate (wildly!) on what might be possible in
                the future üîÆ

              <p>
                This talk presents <code>potions</code>, a library for parsing
                command-line arguments: its features, how Unison is leveraged
                for its implementation (abilities anyone?) and some of the
                paper cuts that hurt during its development.
