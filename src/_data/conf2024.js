      details: `In this talk we‚Äôll look at the implementation of KLogs, a distributed streaming library built entirely on Unison Cloud.

We‚Äôll start our journey in the beautiful landscape of functional programming APIs, and then take an ability handler to the perilous world of distributed systems, a world where we need _fences_, _leases_, _shards_ and _view changes_ to make our system scalable and resilient. We will learn how to implement those standard techniques on Unison Cloud, and then discuss the unique optimisations enabled  by its innovative combination of features.`,
